## SquadOV NEXT

SquadOV's goal is to be the best way to record, watch, and share gaming VODs.
SquadOV NEXT is an open-source rewrite of the old SquadOV client to focus on being offline-first to avoid the heavy financial obligations with an online-first model.
The legacy versions of SquadOV have been open-sourced and can be found for both the [client](https://github.com/SquadOV/SquadOVClient) and the [server](https://github.com/SquadOV/SquadOVApiServer).
SquadOV's philosophy is that gaming VODs are inifitely more useful when the context of what happened in the game is available (game data) and can be synchronized to your friends' VODs as well.
